# YouTube Web App Client

This project is a web application designed to replicate the core features and user interface of YouTube. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my skills in frontend development, specifically in integrating UI/UX design with functional components. Iâ€™ve implemented this project to practice file handling and learn new technologies, such as Tailwind CSS for styling, and to enhance my overall coding proficiency.


## Features

- Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive, providing an optimal user experience across a range of devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones.
- Video Playback: Users can play, pause, and control the video playback using a user-friendly video player interface.
- Advance Search Functionality: A search bar allows users to find videos by keywords, mimicking YouTubeâ€™s search feature.
- Video Thumbnails and Titles: Displays video thumbnails and titles in a grid layout similar to YouTubeâ€™s homepage.
- Channel and Video Information: Each video includes channel information and additional details, including video views and publish date.
- Another Features like Comment, Like and Subscribe a channel are also there.
